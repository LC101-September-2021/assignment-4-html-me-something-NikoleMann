      <h2>What is handpsinning anyways?</h2>
         <!-- a description of what and why is handspinning -->
         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Welcome to handspinning 101! You may be asking yourself what handspinning even is. Well, this is the place to learn. 
            Handspinning is the process of transforming fiber such as wool or cotton into a thread for sewing, weaving, or knitting. 
            You start by creating a single thread called... a <b>single</b>! Simple, right? A finished single can be used as is for something 
            like weaving, or you can spin together multiple singles into a <b>ply</b> to make yarn for knitting or crochet! If this sounds like fun 
            keep on reading to find out how you can start. </p>

            <h2>How is it done?</h2>
         <!-- a walkthrough of the different tools handspinning is done on re:spindles and wheels -->
         <p class="funParagraph">Now before you can start making that dream yarn there's a few basic tools to go over. Spinning has been around for thousands 
            of years but it hasn't always been done the same way. There are a lot of different methods of spinning but they fall into two 
         major catagories: </p>

         <header><b>Spinning Wheels</b></header>
         <p class="funParagraph">If you've ever seen <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> you've seen what's known as a <b>Saxony Wheel</b>. There a a lot of different kinds of 
            spinning wheels but they all share some common factors. Namely, that they use the momentum of a wheel, ranging in size from a 
            few inches to the height of a person, to twist the fiber into a single as it it fed onto a <b>bobbin</b>. (A tool used for storing a 
            single to keep it from getting tangled as it is created). Spinning wheels are great for spinning a lot of fiber very quickly, but they
            are large and can be very pricey. Many are thousands of dollars! So to explore the new world of spinning I reccomend you try one of 
            our next tools. </p>

         <header><b>Spindles</b></header>
         <p class="funParagraph">A classic spindle is a great introduction into the world of handspinning. These wonderful tools have existed across the world for 
            mellenia. At its core a spindle is a long stick with some sort out counter weight that can spin, either suspended in the 
            air or resting against a smooth surface, as the fiber is fed onto it. Many varriations on this technology exist but the most common
            is the drop spindle which comes in three varriations. </p>

            <ol type = 1>
               <li style="color: green;"><b style="color:black">Top whorl Spindles</b>: This is a spindle where the counterweight, usually shaped like a disk, is at the top of the 
               spindle. Above the spindle is a hook that will hold the yarn as the spindle is suspended in the air, and the single will be wound 
               onto the length of the spindle below the whorl.</li>

               <li style="color: green;"><b style="color:black">Bottom Whorl Spindles</b>: This varriation works much the same, except the weight is from the bottom of the spindle. The 
                  single is still created from the top though, and is winds on as it is being made.</li>
               <li style="color: green;"><b style="color:black">Turkish Spindles</b>: A varriation on the bottom whorl where the whorls is actually made of two removalble pieces that cross 
                  each other. These are more popular than a bottom whorl, but harder to use, which is why I reccomend starting on a top whorl. </li>

         <h2>What do I spin though?</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Now that you have your spindle you might be asking yourself, what do I use? Any natural fiber such as wool or cotton. You should use 
            fiber that comes as a <b>roving</b>, that is, a long strand of fibers which have been combed so each individual strand is running the same
            direction. As you work the spinning of the spindle twists the indivudual fibers around each other. Because they are rough on microscopic 
            scale the fibers will catch onto one another and hold themselves in place. Different fiber sources are shaped differently on this microscopic
            level so some will do this more easily than others.</p>
         <p class="funParagraph">One classic fiber to learn on is merino wool which comes from merino sheep. This fiber is a great starting point because it is low cost compared
            to other fibers of its quality and is easy to handle. I don't reccomend starting with a plant fiber as the fibers will have trouble holding on 
            to each other like a protien fiber. Synthetic fibers, like acrylic or polyester, are not feasible for handspiining due to their structure.

      <h2>Time to try it out!</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Handspinning is a pretty hard skill to pick up from just reading; most people need to watch many videos and even find a local spinners
            guild to guide them. I won't leave you to find everything on your own though. Here's a video to get you started. This video from &#34Scribble&#34
            on YouTube shows how to use a bottom whorl spindle but the basic techniques work across <i>all</i> tools, even spinning wheels!
